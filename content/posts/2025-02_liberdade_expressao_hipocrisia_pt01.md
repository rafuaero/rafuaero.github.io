> I shared this note with the Washington Post team this morning:

> I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages. 
 
> We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. 

> There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job. 

> I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity. 

> **I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t “hell yes,” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment —  I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.**"
 
> I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void. 

o chefão mandou, agora as opniões institucionais do Washington Posts são do jeito que eu quiser, e apenas com eu quiser.

isso num anucio falando de liberdades... ah, hipocrisia.


como [notado por john gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/what-if-indeed), pelo menos bezos teve coragem de assumir toda a responsabilidade para ele:

> "I do give Bezos credit for taking public ownership of his assertion of control over the paper opinion pages now. This is a major change, and he's not trying to hide it or shy away from responsibility for it."


lembrando que há cerca de 2 meses já houve o [caso de censura de uma charge](https://anntelnaes.substack.com/p/why-im-quitting-the-washington-post) no mesmo whashing post, liberdade que chama.
